Rails Angular Phonecat Tutorial
---

Just a demo which moves Angular tutorial with Karma unit tests into Rails structure.

Run it:
```
$ bundle install
$ rails s
```

Run client side unit tests, you should install node.js first:
```
$ npm install
$ node_modules/karma/bin/karma start spec/javascripts/karma_config.js
```
